How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	Quite easy to see, althought should be more clear in more friendly way...

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    To know exactly what has been done correctly or incorrectly.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	Personal taste of having work-track record of developing something.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Because sometimes we are working accross multiple files at the same time...for example, HTML and CSS.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    using git log, I can see the message of each commits for which they are changed, and using git diff to know the details of changes from each two commits. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    About that confident but I need more practice!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To continue my course on javascript!
